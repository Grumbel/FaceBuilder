| FaceBuilder ToDo
+--------------

* follow a few more GUI conventions
* select face part from a list instead of via next/previous toggles
* add much more face parts
* adjust all face parts to follow a standard convention (pupils in
  center of, hair relative to the center of the face, etc) so that
  they are easier swapable without size and position adjustments
* support for different sets, male/female, comic, realistic, etc
